The customer's list should be displayed using data tables ( search, sort )
The customer list should have an additional column that displays the number of hotels they have( only on UI )
Hotels:

Hotels list should contain an additional column that displays the customer  name as an owner ( only on UI )
The hotel list should be displayed using data tables ( search, sort )
When fetching the hotels address details from DB all columns related to the address should be built and fetched as JSON ( address: {} )

Note: 
The DB should have two users one is an admin another one is an app_user. 
The admin user can able to perform all operations, but app_user can only perform READ.
